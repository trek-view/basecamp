    <p><strong>The Basingstoke Canal runs for 51 kilometres, from Greywell Village in Hampshire to Woodham in Surrey.</strong></p>

    <p>Completed in 1794, it was built to connect Basingstoke with the River Thames at Weybridge via the Wey Navigation.</p>

    <p>Today the canal not only serves as a recreational waterway but is also a notable wildlife habitat -- the entire waterway, except for a length through Woking, was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1995.</p>

    <h3>Future of the Canal</h3>

    <p>Apart from lack of funding, the Canal’s other major problem is lack of water.</p>

    <p>Increased levels of water abstraction together with climate change have meant that use of the locks has had to be suspended for large parts of the summer.</p>

    <p>The Basingstoke Canal Society has been instrumental in installing back-pumping schemes to enable the locks to keep working in dry periods.</p>

    <p>As the guardian of the Basingstoke Canal, the Society promotes and campaigns for the sustainable future of the Canal as a navigation.</p>

    <p>There are many ways in which you can support the Basingstoke Canal Society and the Canal.</p>
