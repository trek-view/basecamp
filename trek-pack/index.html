	<h3>About the Trek Pack</h3>

	<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/pages/trek-pack/trek-pack-v2-emptied.jpg" alt="Trek Pack v2" title="Trek Pack v2" />

	<p>Some of you will have already seen our <a href="/trek-pack/v1/">Trek Pack v1</a>. A few of you reading this probably own one too.</p>

	<p>Our v1's have covered over 100,000 of kilometers.</p>

	<p>At the end of 2019 GoPro launched the successor to their Fusion camera (used on the v1), the MAX. Since its release we've been busy testing its functionality and performance.</p>

	<p>We're now confident the GoPro MAX is the best consumer camera for outdoor tour photography based on its price, durability, extendability, and availability of accessories. As such, the Trek Pack v2 is now fitted with the GoPro MAX.</p>

	<p>We've made a few small improvements based on feedback and lessons learned from trekkers shooting with the v1 pack.</p>

	<p>We hope you like them...</p>
