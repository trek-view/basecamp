	<h3>About the Trek Pack</h3>

	<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/pages/trek-pack/trek-pack-emptied-sm.jpg" alt="Trek Pack v1" title="Trek Pack v1" />

	<p>In 2018, I wanted to add some of my favourite hiking routes to Google Street View.</p>

	<p>As consumer grade 360-degree cameras entered the market, this became possible.</p>

	<p>Consequently, I set out to find an affordable 360-degree camera that:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Is Street View Ready (shooting at or above 4K resolution, has a GPS sensor);</li>
		<li>Can be used without fear of getting damaged by light rain showers (I live in England after all)</li>
		<li>Has storage and battery life for tours up to 20 kilometres on foot</li>
		<li>Can be mounted to a backpack and mount that could easily be setup and taken down for travel</li>
		<li>Has software that could be used to easily process imagery on non-professional grade equipment</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The Trek Pack was the result.</p>

	<p>The Trek Pack allows you to use the power of the GoPro Fusion without the hassle of manually taking photos or carrying bulky equipment. Simply setup the camera to start shooting and get on your way.</p>
