**A quick look at some of the things we've been working on over the last few months.**

Firstly I’d like to say a big thank you to everyone who has uploaded their off-road 360 tours to [Map the Paths](https://www.mapthepaths.com/).

We passed a milestone of 100,000 panoramas uploaded at the start of the year. Onto 1 million!

I’d like to use this post to share some of the recent features we’ve shipped.

## Overlay of OSM and Wikipedia Points of Interest

See what's nearby to an image on Map the Paths using OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia data overlays.

## Weather reports

View the weather at the time of capture for any Map the Paths image.

## Commenting on photos

Comment on your favourite images uploaded to Map the Paths and start a conversation.

## Navigate by altitude

Find the best views using the altitude navigation on Map the Paths.

[p.s. You can so sort photos by viewpoint to find the very best views](https://www.mapthepaths.com/sequence/photo).

## Custom banners

Overlay custom messages and URLs as banners to your sequences on Map the Paths.

## Augmented reality sequences

Track an entire Map the Paths Sequence by showing the entire route augmented over each photo.

## Do you have an idea for a new feature?
