**Map the Paths offers the ability to create guided virtual tours complete with annotations and videos.**

Sadly, Google is shutting down [Tour Creator](https://poly.google.com/creator/tours) on June 30th (2021). That's less than 3 weeks before any tours you've created there will disappear.

We're particularity saddened by Google's decision to remove Tour Creator as it brings back many happy memories from a time of very few (the start of the COVID-19 lockdowns here in the UK).

With the help of Tour Creator we ran our [Treehouse virtual adventures for children](/blog/2020/treehouse-academy-emergency-timetable) and [locally guided tours of historic sites for adults](/blog/2020/virtual-tours-guided-by-local-experts).

[At that point we also wrote a detailed post about how you can use the Tour Creator with your own class or, as many did, with friends and family](/blog/2020/build-virtual-expeditions-for-your-class).

[Google's support page recommends you download your tour data before the shutdown date](https://support.google.com/tourcreator/):

> Tip: Your downloaded .zip file includes:
> 
> * Image files, including panorama photos
> * Sound files
> * JSON files with scene descriptions, text references, and Street View panorama references

But where do you use this exported content instead?

## Enter Map the Paths Guidebooks

[I've previously written](/blog/2020/map-the-paths-guidebooks) about how Guidebooks allow you to annotate 2D/360 scenes, giving you the opportunity to act as a local expert using your own, or someone else's imagery.

Since that post we've added a number of Guidebook features. Here are 3 of them your class (or family) will find useful:

### Image and Video References

Many of you asked for the ability to add images and videos to a Point of Interest (POI) annotation in the scene, in addition to title and description.

This feature is particularly nice as it gives you the ability to offer a more detailed explanation of the POI topic through a video or richer image.

You can also add images and videos to the whole scene description too.

### Links to External Sources

Similarly, we also observed many people pasting URL's into the description fields of a POI, taking up valuable characters.

We've now made a dedicated field for external URL's so you can add as many links to external sites for further information or citations as desired.

### Point of Interest classification

When you add Point of Interests to a scene you can now classify them. Classifications offer a quick way to describe the content of the POI for the viewers. Examples of classifications include; geography and history.

## Show us what you build

[Here's a recent Guidebook from our Kilimanjaro summit via the Rongai Route (read more about the drastic change in vegetation and landscapes as you virtually climb the mountain)](https://www.mapthepaths.com/guidebook/1d8221a5-20f1-4b8d-ad2d-cd69604d70d2/detail/).

Please do share Guidebooks you've created on Map the Paths with us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/trekview/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trekview). I'll make sure we repost as many as possible.
