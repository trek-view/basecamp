	<h3>The Trek Pack Loan program ended in January 2022</h3>

	<p>Thanks to everyone who loaned a camera, and everyone who applied. Sadly, due to a number of abuses, we decided to end the program in January 2022.</p>

	<p>You can still build your own trek Pack. <a href="/trek-pack">Full instructions here</a>.</p>
