**The story of one mans journey from Central to South America on the Pacific on a raft, powered by a motorcycle.**

In 2010 Dylan dreamt of travelling the world on a motorcycle. After setting off from Switzerland in 2010 and journeying 200,000km, the road from Panama to Colombia came to an end, swallowed up by an impenetrable jungle.

The solution? Dylan built a raft powered by his motorcycle engine in the hope of reaching Colombia's road network 700km away. He had to brave strong ocean currents and storms during his journey from Central to South America on the Pacific.

In this episode of ExPODition, David talks with Dylan Wickrama about what it's like to live on a motorcycle powered raft out in the Pacific for 49 days.

The conversation was recorded remotely on November 5th, 2020.
