What are you waiting for?

[360-Degree cameras are now fairly affordable](https://www.google.com/streetview/contacts-tools/products/). For Â£300 you can buy a 360-degree camera, telescopic pole, backpack, with room left for beer money.

That's not to say the first camera rigs were bad. Far from it.

I get many emails asking how people can build their own 360-degree Trek Pack.

So here it is.

## Do-it-yourself Street View

Over the next four weeks I'll detail how I built the original Trek View Trek Pack, the Trek Pack, then used it to shoot, process, and publish 360-degree photo tours to Google Street View.

I'll detail my thought process in buying kit through to some of the lessons learned, often the hard way, about shooting 360-degree tours for Google Street View.

And, yes. I'll show you how to remove the monopod from the image. Hint: it's not magic.

Though my general advice is; don't get lost reading too many internet posts, including mine. You learn the most by taking photos and making mistake (no one's perfect).
