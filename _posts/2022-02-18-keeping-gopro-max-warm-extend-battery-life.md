**If you've ever tried using electronics in very cold weather you might have watched why your battery draining quickly.**

When trying to capture footage on a GoPro in the mountains during winter you might have seen this too, or even had issue getting the camera to even turn on.

GoPro recently announced a [new high-performance Enduro battery designed for cold temperatures.](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/mounts-accessories/enduro-extended-cold-weather-battery/ADBAT-011-WS.html) The bad news? It's currently only available for HERO10 and HERO9 action cameras.

In a few weeks time I'll be heading to the Alps to capture some ski footage (more on that to follow on the blog soon), so designing a setup that could be kept warm for a full day in colder temperatures is vital.

## Batteries and cold weather

Batteries use a chemical reaction to make power. Since chemical reactions slow down in cold weather, chemical reactions don't happen as quickly. That means the battery can't generate as much power when compared to warmer temperatures.

The reverse is true hot temperatures. The chemical reactions will increase and the battery may over-perform.  Because of this, high temperatures for prolonged periods can actually shorten battery life, as the chemical reactions occur faster.
 
There's also another reason. As the temperature drops, the internal resistance of your battery goes up. That means more of your battery's power is wasted â€“ so your battery has to work harder. Hence, you'll see the charge go down much faster than if you stayed inside.

In very cold temperatures, the battery might not be able to generate enough power and the camera won't turn on at all.

So the main challenge is keeping the battery warm.

## Planning GoPro MAX Insulation

The MAX poses some unique challenges when trying to keep the body insulated, and therefore the battery warm.

With the HERO body can be easily covered in an insulating jacket to protect it from the external conditions.

Various covers, [like microphone wind protectors](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Windslayer-Reduction-Sponge-Muffler-Housing/dp/B08PTRBZ91?th=1) for HERO camera illustrate how thick the cover can be before it encroaches on the lenses field of view.

In very cold temperatures you could include heat warmers inside the jacket, on the back of the camera, to increase the internal temperature.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2022-02-18/gopro-max-dimensions.jpeg" alt="GoPro MAX Dimensions" title="GoPro MAX Dimensions" />

A similar approach is not possible with the MAX. There is only a small space on the front and back of the camera's body before any jacket will impede the view (about 2mm). It is the section most exposed to the elements.

There is more area around the top, bottom, and sides of the camera, where there are blind spots, but it's not particularly effective or practical to do so.

I released quite quickly, that for optimum conditions I would need to rely on an external battery power source that could be kept warm more easily.

## Using an External batter GoPro MAX Insulation

It's possible to use an external power source with the MAX. [We actually recommend using one with our Trek Pack](https://guides.trekview.org/trek-pack/v2/kit-setup/external-power-pack).

The advantage of using an external pack means not only can it be kept warm more easily, but also offers more power. 

I have an Anker PowerCore+ 26800mA. [Official GoPro MAX batteries are 1600mA](https://gopro.com/en/gb/shop/mounts-accessories/max-rechargeable-battery/ACBAT-001.html). So the PowerCore+ holds almost 17x more charge then the standard MAX battery.

In warm conditions, we can get about 2-2.5 hours out of a single GoPro battery in video mode, therefore, I should be able to easily use the PowerCore to shoot continuously for an entire day if I can keep it warm.

The Trek Pack has a useful top pocket which perfectly fits the PowerCore and has room for an electronic hand warmer ([here's the electronic one I use](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08HQQJ4WM)). To further insulate it I also place it in a thick fleece pocket.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2022-02-18/gopro-trek-pack-battery-secure.jpg" alt="Trek Pack External Battery Pocket" title="Trek Pack External Battery Pocket" />

I can zip the pocket almost shut to protect the batter from the weather, leaving it slightly unzipped to run the USC-A (from the Powercore) to USB-C (to the MAX) out.

The cable I use is 0.9m long. [Here's the exact one I use if you're wondering](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07DD5YHMH/).

0.9m is about perfect for running it to a MAX mounted on a helmet, offering just enough slack to allow for lots of movement, but is not too long to risk getting easily caught on anything. That said, I'd be very careful of branches when tree skiing.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2022-02-18/helmet-trek-pack.jpg" alt="GoPro MAX Helmet Trek pack" title="GoPro MAX Helmet Trek pack" />

I use a Smith Level MIPS helmet. It's almost perfect for this use as I can run the cable through the straps of the helmet. This keeps the cable more flush with the helmet and in the side view of the camera, where there are blindspots.

## Dealing with connecting the USB cable to the MAX

Running a cable into the camera poses another problem. The protective door of the camera needs to be removed. This exposes the battery bay, MicroSD card reader and internals of the camera to the elements.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2022-02-18/gopro-max-dimensions.jpeg" alt="GoPro MAX Dimensions" title="GoPro MAX Dimensions" />

In searching for insulation options for the MAX [I came across a silicone case](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/293976420452). It's only about 0.5mm thick and offers minimal insulation, however, it does prove very useful in offering some weatherproofing.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2022-02-18/gopro-max-silicone-case-usb-c-hole.jpg" alt="GoPro MAX Silicone case" title="GoPro MAX Silicone case" />

I needed to make a hole in the silicon case to make an opening for the cable. [I did this using a cheap leather hold punch](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00SQ99NW8). _Yes, it could be made to look a lot nicer_.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2022-02-18/gopro-max-silicone-case-usb-c-hole.jpg-connected.jpg" alt="GoPro MAX Silicone case" title="GoPro MAX Silicone case" />

The hole is slightly smaller then the diameter of the end of the cable, which makes for a snug fit. The snug git means the silicone also helps hold the cable securely in place (whilst still offering quick release for safety, should the cable get caught).

I have also added some cardboard padding to keep the battery in place, as there is a slight air-gap between the case and battery when the door is removed.

Once the case has been assembled you shouldn't need to take it off at all (there's need to fiddle with the cardboard and case each time). The images and video from the SD card can be downloaded and managed by connecting the camera to your laptop.

The final touch comes courtesy of my mum. In order to provide some minimal protection for the screen from the elements she showed up a sock that is just thin enough (about 1mm) to avoid obstructing the lenses field of view.

## Why I use this setup for skiing

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2022-02-18/full-helmet-trek-pack.jpg" alt="GoPro MAX Trek Pack skiing" title="GoPro MAX Trek Pack skiing" />

I designed this setup to not only offer a full day of battery life, but to also need minimal attention when on the mountain.

Paired a GoPro remote in my pocket I can start and stop recording easily, even with mitts on. There's no need to switch out batteries that can be fiddly at the best of time.

It can also be easily used on lifts. The backpack profile is slim enough so it can be warn whilst sitting, the helmet mount is also easily cleared by most lift bars (something that would be problematic with a monopod).

Though the real test comes when I make it to the mountains. Bring it on!
