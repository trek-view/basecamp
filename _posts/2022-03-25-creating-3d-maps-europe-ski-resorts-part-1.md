**And a brief update on using the GoPro MAX cold weather setup.**

[A few weeks ago I talked about the problems cold temperatures have on LiIon batteries, and how I was preparing my kit for cold weather](/blog/2022/keeping-gopro-max-warm-extend-battery-life).

As those that know me might have guessed, this is because I was going skiing!

Over the past 4 weeks I've visited the following French resorts:

* Val Thorens
* Meribel
* Courchevel
* La Plagne
* Les Arcs
* Chamonix Valley
	* Flegere
	* Brevant
	* Les Houches
	* Grand Montets
	* Le Tour
* Tignes
* Val D'Isere

After 4 weeks of skiing (and a few rest days) I am pleased to report the setup has held up perfectly.

That said, it has been very warm in the French Alps for the last month (as hot at 14 degrees in mid-March), which has, sadly, resulted in very little snowfall.

The blue skies that the Alps have seen over the last month have given me some amazing conditions for filming though.

In total, finishing this morning, I've skied over 1500 kilometers across 27 days. In many resorts I have managed to capture almost every marked piste, and some amazing off-piste runs too.

My aim now is to use the footage I've shot to create street level tours the pistes.

Next week I plan to start processing the videos. In summary there is;

* 3 terabytes of footage
* Representing 10 hours, 55 minutes, and 06 seconds
* Over a total of 889 videos

I'll leave you with a little sneak peak, from one of my all time favourite runs filmed last week, the Vallee Blanche off the Aiguille du Midi (3,842m) in Chamonix.

Stay tuned for a progress update in the next month or so!
