**And a brief update on using the GoPro MAX cold weather setup.**

[A few weeks ago I talked about the problems cold temperatures have on LiIon batteries, and how I was preparing my kit for cold weather](/blog/2022/keeping-gopro-max-warm-extend-battery-life.md).

As those that know me might have guessed, this is because I was going skiing!

Over the past 4 weeks I've visited the following French resorts:

* Val Thorens
* Meribel
* Courchevel
* La Plagne
* Les Arcs
* Argentiere
* Chamonix Valley
	* Flegere
	* Brevant
	* Les Houches
	* Grand Montets
	* Le Tour
* Tignes
* Val D'Isere

After 4 weeks of skiing (and a few rest days) and can report the setup is holding up well.

That said, it has been very warm in the French Alps for the last month (as hot at 14 degrees in mid-March), which has, sadly, resulted in very little snowfall.

My aim now is to use the footage I've shot to create street level tours the pistes in some of the worlds most famous resorts.

Next week I plan to start processing the 5 terabytes of videos (covering almost every piste in these resorts).

I'll leave you with a little sneak peak, from one of my all time favourite runs, the Vallee Blanche.

Stay tuned for more in the next month or so!
