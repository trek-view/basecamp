**And a brief update on using the GoPro MAX cold weather setup.**

[A few weeks ago I talked about the problems cold temperatures have on LiIon batteries, and how I was preparing my kit for cold weather](/blog/2022/keeping-gopro-max-warm-extend-battery-life.md).

As those that know me might have guessed, this is because I was going skiing!

Over the past 4 weeks I've visited the following French resorts:

* Val Thorens
* Meribel
* Courchevel
* La Plagne
* Les Arcs
* Chamonix Valley
	* Flegere
	* Brevant
	* Les Houches
	* Grand Montets
	* Le Tour
* Tignes
* Val D'Isere

After 4 weeks of skiing (and a few rest days) and can report the setup is holding up well.

That said, it has been very warm in the French Alps for the last month (as hot at 14 degrees in mid-March), which has, sadly, resulted in very little snowfall.

The blue skies that the Alps have seen over the last month have given me some amazing conditions for filming.

In total, finishing this morning, I've skied over 1500 kilometers over 27 days. In many resorts I've captured almost all the pistes, and some amazing off-piste runs too.

My aim now is to use the footage I've shot to create street level tours the pistes in some of the worlds most famous resorts.

Next week I plan to start processing the videos. In summary there is;

* 3 terabytes of footage
* Representing 10 hours, 55 minutes, and 06 seconds
* For a total of 889 videos

I'll leave you with a little sneak peak, from one of my all time favourite runs filmed last week, the Vallee Blanche off the Aiguille du Midi in Chamonix.

Stay tuned for more in the next month or so!
