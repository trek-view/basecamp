**Two totally different characters, jammed together in two square metres of space for almost two years as they travel across Africa.**

When Lena and Ulli start the engine of their old Land Rover, Lady Ter√©s, they have a plan: to drive from Hamburg to South Africa in six months. What they don't know yet is that they won't ever get there.

Two totally different characters, jammed together in two square metres of space for almost two years, they experience what it really means to travel: leaving your comfort zone for good. 

In this episode of ExPODition, David talks with  Ulrich Stirnat and Lena Wendt about the trials and tribulations of an overland crossing of the African continent. 

The conversation was recorded remotely on November 20th, 2020.
