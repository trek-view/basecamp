**Float and shoot.**

One of my favourite places to capture 360-degree tours is on the water.

## Choosing a mode of transport

The obvious choice would be to use a boat. Though in line with our [Environment Charter](/charters/environment), I wanted something greener.

A canoe seemed like a good option, but it was difficult to find a good mount point for the camera. It was the same story in a kayak. In both instances, a Trek Pack proved problematic due to the movement of my torso and arms when paddling.

Then I discovered stand up paddle boarding (SUP'ing).

Inflatable SUP's are easy to transport, very stable in Grade I conditions (inc. small ocean waves), and paddling does not move your torso anywhere near as much as when sitting in a canoe or kayak. Thus, making a Trek Pack perfectly suited to SUP tours.

## Touring SUPs

There are three basic types of stand up paddle boards: surf, allround, and flatwater/race. 

For shooting 360-degree tours, I use a Model II board produced by the UK company [Two Bare Feet](https://www.twobarefeet.co.uk/).

The board is now discontinued but Two Bare Feet still sell many similar boards under different names.

It is a very stable, inflatable board that can be rolled away and packed into a large bag with rucksack straps. I carry it on and off trains with ease. Being inflatable it is also lightweight (something I don't take for granted when carrying around locks, white water, etc.).

_Note: Avoid cheap plastic paddles. You'll soon regret the small amount of money you will have saved over a more rigid carbon-hybrid paddle. I did!_

The board and paddle have lasted me 3 years, and counting. I really can't fault it. Though I'd recommend hiring one first to get a feel for what's out there.

## Dry bag everything

[The GoPro Fusion, when camera doors are closed, is waterproof to 5m](https://gopro.com/help/articles/question_answer/is-fusion-waterproof-without-a-housing), though (thankfully) I have not had chance to test this. _Famous last words._

Other electronics you carry -- spare batteries, car keys, etc. -- are probably not waterproof.

I'd recommend something to protect them. Good dry bags are useful for a multitude of purposes beyond carrying electronics. [I use Exped Dry bags](http://www.exped.com/uk-ireland/en/product-category/packsacks).

## The boring stuff

* Wear a personal floatation device (PFD). I use a [Red Paddle Co Airbelt PFD](https://redpaddleco.com/en-gb/accessory/airbelt-personal-flotation-device-pfd/)
* Make sure you are allowed on the waterway ([in the UK you'll need a Waterways license](https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/membership/why-join-british-canoeing/waterways-licence))
* Check the conditions before you set out. Especially if you're shooting in open water.
* Pack for all conditions. Water, sunscreen, snacks, suitable clothing. Assume you'll be gone for 3 times longer than expected, and that the weather will change.
* Let someone know where you are going and when you plan to be back.

It might sound obvious, but speaking to [RNLI volunteers](https://rnli.org/support-us/become-a-volunteer/how-you-can-volunteer/be-a-lifeboat-station-volunteer) it's shocking how many people do none of these things!

## Call for Paddlers

[I'm looking for Trekkers to help capture new 360-degree water tours over the autumn](/blog/2019/call-for-trekkers-summer-autumn/), before the weather really turns.

I can supply the waterproof 360-degree camera kit. You just need to supply the effort and mode of transport.

If you have a great place on the water you want to capture a virtual tour of for others to enjoy, please [apply to the Trek View camera loan program today](/loan) -- I have Trek Packs ready for Trekkers.
