**Comparing the four heavyweights.**

[Google first launched Street View in 2007](/blog/2019/history-of-google-street-view-cameras). 

The tech giants -- Microsoft, Apple and Facebook -- now all products built around street-level imagery.

Here's a short comparison of them:

## Age

* Google: Street View (launched: 2007)
* Microsoft: Streetside (launched: 2009)
* Facebook: Mapillary (launched: 2013)
* Apple: Look Around (launched: 2019)

## Coverage

Google wins hands down. [According to the CNET article posted December 2019](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-maps-has-now-photographed-10-million-miles-in-street-view/), there is 10 million miles (16.1 million km) of Street View imagery online.

At the time of writing the [Mapillary home page](https://www.mapillary.com/) proudly claims 1,289,873,858 images uploaded. It is unclear how many kilometers this represents. As a reference point, [in July 2018 Mapillary claimed 5 million kilometers (but sadly no image count)](https://blog.mapillary.com/update/2018/07/31/five-million-km-mapillary-coverage.html). Unlike Street View, this count assumes all user uploaded images not unique kilometers where in some cases roads have been captured multiple times.

Apple's look around is the newest street-level offering on the market. [In April 2020](https://9to5mac.com/2020/04/21/apple-maps-look-around-cities), the sevice covered 10 areas in the US. As of August 2020, [this site claims Look Around now covers 14 metropolitan areas, with the addition of Seatle, Nagoya, Osaka/Kyoto, Tokyou](https://www.justinobeirne.com/look-around-coverage-areas).

I could not find any official numbers for Streetside coverage, but I would estimate it sits below Street View and Mapillary from a simple glance of coverage using the Bing Maps web app.

## Community

Apple's Look Around does not support any kind of user contributions of imagery.

[In 2010 it looked like Streetside accepted user submissions](https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2010/02/11/new-bing-maps-application-streetside-photos). However, I cannot find any references to uploading your own imagery in the current iteration of the product.

Google has managed to foster a large community of high-quality contributors using their [Street View ready program](https://www.google.com/streetview/contacts-tools/products/). Both camera manufacturers, and software builders (ourselves included), can build ontop of the Street View platform. 

Mapillary is prodominatly user submitted imagery. [It appears they did start to run a driver program in 2020](https://forum.mapillary.com/t/mapillary-drivers-program/2649), which I imagine [is superseeded after the aquistion by Facebook's own imagery collection](https://medium.com/@joemorrison/why-on-earth-did-facebook-just-acquire-mapillary-9838405272f8). Users can also modify uploaded imagery [using changesets](https://help.mapillary.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001638129-Editing-sequences), making it by far and away the most community orientated platform. 

## Quality

Google, Apple, and Microsoft all run their own driving programs using professional equipment. For example, [Google spend 10's of thousands on camera and sensor equipment for each car](/blog/2020/google-street-view-cameras-more-than-meets-the-eye). All imagery on these three services is 360.

[Google Street View also has very strict Street View Ready Pro criteria for user submitted imagery](https://developers.google.com/streetview/ready/specs-prograde).

Mapillary does things slightly differently. [The majority of photos are from single sensor dash and action cameras](https://campfire.trekview.org/t/an-interesting-analysis-of-images-submitted-to-mapillary-by-camera-type/322). Quality checks on upload by Mapillary are limited. In many cases you'll come across low-quality dashcam footage (for example, with rain on the windscreen).

That said, Mapillary also hosts lots of high-quality captures. The team at [Mosaic51](https://www.mosaic51.com/) use Mapillary to [showcase professional footage captured by their own camera rig](https://www.mapillary.com/app/org/mosaic51).

## Privacy 

[Last week I took a look at each service deals with image removal and blurring](/blog/2020/how-to-blur-street-level-images), with the exception of Apple's Look Around.

[Apple's stance is as follows](https://maps.apple.com/imagecollection/):

> For questions or concerns about this process, your right to privacy, or for requests to have a face, license plate or your own home made unrecognizable , please contact us.

I don't see any major differences in each companies privacy stance (when taken at face value...).

## The Future

You can see [where the Google Street View cars will be next here](https://www.google.com/streetview/), and [where Apple Look Around cars will be next here](https://maps.apple.com/imagecollection/).

Whilst I can't find anything confirming it, I would be very confident that Microsoft's Streetsde cars are still on the road too.

Mapillary is likely to grow quickly [after the recent Facebook aquisition](https://blog.mapillary.com/news/2020/06/18/Mapillary-joins-Facebook.html), and the big pockets that affords them. Where they'll be next? Well that depends on the 1000's of contributors.
