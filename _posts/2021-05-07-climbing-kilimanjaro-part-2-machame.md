**The second most popular route on Mount Kilimanjaro can now be hiked from home.**

If you missed last weeks post, [we're in the process of mapping Kilimanjaro with our Trek Packs](/blog/2021/climbing-kilimanjaro-part-1-the-kit).

For our first trek our guide and cameraman, Joshua, will be tackling the Machame route.

Also known as the _Whiskey_ route, it is the second most popular route on Mount Kilimanjaro.

It starts in the tropical rainforest, approaches the peak area through the southern face of Mt Kilimanjaro and summit is done through Barafu Summit Camp. Descent is done through Mweka Route. 

## Rainforest (1,800m)

Moss-covered trees, seas of ferns and elusive monkeys abound in the rainforests that surround the mountain.

## Moorland (3,000m)

The thick rainforest starts to thin out. At an altitude of almost 3,000 meters (around 9,800 ft) you have arrived at the beginning of the moorland. Shorter trees as well as an increasing number of ferns and mosses are typical for this vegetation zone.

## Alpine desert (4,000m)

Now you have arrived at an altitude of about 4,000 meters (around 13,100 ft). The ascent is mostly less steep than before, and you’re walking on paths across seemingly endless expanses and scree fields.

## Volcanic Craters (5,000m)

Kilimanjaro has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi and Shira. Kibo, the youngest and highest, retains the form of a typical volcanic cone and crater.

## Uhuru Peak (5,895m)

<iframe width="600" height="400" allowfullscreen style="border-style:none;" src="https://www.trekview.org/trekviewer.htm#panorama=https://www.trekview.org/assets/images/blog/2021-05-07/kili-uhuru-peak.jpeg&amp;autoLoad=true"></iframe>

Congratulations you are now at Uhuru Peak, Tanzania. 5895 AMSL.

## Altezza Travel

This Guidebook would not have been possible without the studious team at Altezza Travel.

They're taking bookings for the 2021 season, including the Machame route. [See the Altezza Travel website for more details](https://en.altezza.travel/).

## More soon...

Sadly the weather meant we couldn't film the entire Machame route. 

When the good weather for trekking returns again in June, we'll be hoping for a few more drier days to [capture the missing imagery with our Trek Packs](/trek-pack).

Next week I'll be sharing Joshua's imagery from the Rongai Route...
