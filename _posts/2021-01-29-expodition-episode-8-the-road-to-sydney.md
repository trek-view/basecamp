**Zac Newham embarks on a 25,000 mile ride from his home in Ifield, England to Sydney, Australia.**

In 2013 Zac Newham embarked on a 25,000 mile solo cycle ride from his home in England to Sydney, Australia on his budget childhood bicycle.

His film, The Road to Sydney, portrays a truthful (albeit whirlwind!) snapshot of this epic year and a half long journey on two wheels and palpably puts us all in the saddle as he pedals his way east.

Funny, simple, unpretentious and full of good cheer.

In this episode of ExPODition, David talks with Zac Newham about his bicycle ride half way round the world.

The conversation was recorded remotely on January 11th, 2021.
