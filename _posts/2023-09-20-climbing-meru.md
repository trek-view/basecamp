**We're back in Tanzania, this time for Kilimanjaro's little brother.**

A few years ago we set out on an adventure to map many of the routes up Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain.

During that expedition, on many occasions we heard about Mount Meru, Kilimanjaro's little brother.

On a clear day, Meru can be seen from the summit of Kilimanjaro, 70 kilometers to the West, standing at 4,566 meters.

Mount Meru is Tanzania's second-highest peak and is classed as a dormant volcano, last erupting about 100 years ago (Kilimanjaro is an extinct volcano).

What really perked our interest in Meru was the fact many classed it as a more technical climb compared to the routes up Kilimanjaro, which are well established and don't require any scrambling.

And so, afew years later, we set out to capture 360 footage of Mount Meru, with support from the [Greg Adventures team](https://gregadventures.com/) led by our professional guide, Saladini Mshana.

## The Plan

We set out again with the Trek Pack v2, and a two external powerpacks. [It was exactly the same setup as we used for Kilimanjaro](/blog/climbing-kilimanjaro-part-1-the-kit/).

Meru can be climbed in three days, stopping at the Mirikamba Hut on day one and Saddle Hut at day two. Both days are fairly easy walks, taking around 5 hours each day. On day two, an afternoon hike up to Little Meru (3,820 meters) for acclimatisation is advised.

On day three, summit attempts usually start at around 0100 to reach Meru's summit in time for sunrise. Day three also involves a long hike down to the base, taking a slightly different route on the final part of the descent after Miriakamba hut.

Like Kilimanjaro, the environment changes on dramatically on the way up. Starting in the lush tropical forests of Arusha National Park where a whole host of wildlife can be seen (and is the reason why a park ranger with a gun is required on all hikes) to the cold, dry, desert like conditions at the peak.

If you're considering the hike, here are some of the key parts to it, all of which are available to explore virtually on Street View.

## How can I do this?

Hopefully this has inspired many of you to try to record your own footage this season and place it on the map. The good news; it's not as difficult as you might think.

Here is everything you need to know;

1. [Build your own Trek Pack](/trek-pack)
3. Record the footage of your adventure in video mode
3. Upload it to Google Street View
