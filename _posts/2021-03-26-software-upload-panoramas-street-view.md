**Here are four options you can use to upload your 360 photos to Street View.**

A lot of guidance exists around creating virtual tours of businesses.

Ben Claremontâ€™s, [Which Is The Best Virtual Tour Software? (November 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKkQQ0aHRSc), video is a good example of the types of comparisons that exist.

Many of the software products mentioned in that video do include the ability to upload the imagery to Google Street View, but in many cases the workflows and comparisons are based on shooting in a small, controlled area indoors.

I'm yet to find a comprehensive comparison of tools for outdoor, off-road Street View uploads.

[Last week I took a look at the Google Street View app in detail](/blog/2021/using-google-street-view-app). This week I'll take a look at other alternatives available to off-road street-level 360 photographers.

## Google Street View App

**Cost**

* Free

**Type**

* Mobile App:
	- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/google-street-view/id904418768)
	- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street&hl=en_GB&gl=US)

**Version reviewed**

Android 2.0.0.350158636 (publish date: 5th Jan 2021)

**Overview**

Overall this is a solid choice if you're taking a few photos with your phone, or want to connect it [to a supported 360 camera](https://developers.google.com/streetview/ready) for short adventures.

Doing everything on a phone does limit your ability to process photos or videos before upload.

Phone battery life also becomes an issue when shooting long tours and it's very likely you'll need an external power pack for your phone to ensure it remains charged.

## GoThru StreetBuilder

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2021-03-26/gothru-streetbuilder.jpg" alt="GoThru StreetBuilder" title="GoThru StreetBuilder" />

**Cost**

* Free for processing photos but pricing starts at $10 per 2 tours uploaded to Street View

**Type**

* Desktop app
	- [Mac](https://streetbuilder.co/)
	- [PC](https://streetbuilder.co/)

**Version reviewed**

1.0.34.

**Overview**

GoThru was one of the first companies in the market that allowed people to create indoor virtual tours and upload them to Street View seamlessly.

StreetBuilder is great at helping extract the correct panoramas from videos or sequences of photos prior to upload.

To upload to Street View, you first need to upload to the GoThru platform and then publish Street View. This requires a paid GoThru plan, which means if you're uploading a high number of tours it can quickly become very expensive.

## Panoskin Trailblazer

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2021-03-26/panoskin-trailblazer.jpg" alt="Panoskin Trailblazer" title="Panoskin Trailblazer" />

**Cost**

* Free

**Type**

* Desktop app
	- [Mac](https://www.panoskin.com/trailblazer)
	- [PC](https://www.panoskin.com/trailblazer)

**Version reviewed**

1.2.0

**Overview**

Trailblazer was the app that got me into capturing adventure footage for Street View, so Panoskin have a special place in my heart.

The app only works with GoPro Fusion video and photo files. Content from the newer GoPro MAX cameras are not compatible.

What I really like about Trailblazer is its ability to add local metadata to content, for example, what method of transport you used to capture with. The fact they don't charge for uploads to Street View also earns it a plus point!

Which one is your favourite?
