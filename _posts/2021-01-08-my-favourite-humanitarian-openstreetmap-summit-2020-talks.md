**Mapping projects to improve disaster and development outcomes.**

On the 4th of December 2020, [the humanitarian OpenStreetMap community convened for a global virtual meeting](https://summit2020.hotosm.org/
) to showcase projects, discuss and share ideas, and learn how mapping projects can have impact on the lives beyond the people mapping and create better disaster and development outcomes.

[You can browse the full programs from each of the three world blocks here](https://summit2020.hotosm.org/program/).

Here are my personal favourites...

Americas block.

Katie Pickett from the [Cadasta Foundation](https://cadasta.org/) discusses the issues of land rights and resources ownership that communities in different parts of the world face. In many cases their land is under customary ownership and many governments do not legally recognise this ownership, which is where mapping can help.

Americas block.

Natalia da Silveria from the [GeoLab at the Universidad de Antioquia](http://www.udea.edu.co/) discusses the SIG en Bici (GIS in Bike) project that is researching how people navigate through cities on back to identify ways to optimise their routes (for speed, safety, etc.).

This is project is particularity close to our hearts, [with our ongoing crowdsourced initiatives to build safer bicycle lanes in cities](/blog/2020/challenge-map-amsterdam-by-bicycle). I've already emailed the SIG en Bici team...
