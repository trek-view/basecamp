**The biggest pain of working with geospatial software; determining the way they present latitude and longitude... or is that longitude and latitude?**

Geospatial software has a fundamental inconsistency: the order in which longitude and latitude is displayed.

Let us start by taking a look at the problem this causes.

The summit of Mount Everest has a latitude of `27.986065` and longitude is `86.922623`.

Google search expect [decimal co-ordinates](/blog/2021/reading-decimal-gps-coordinates-like-a-computer) provided as `lat,lon`.

If I search lat,lon; [`27.986065,86.922623`](https://www.google.com/search?q=86.922623%2C27.986065), it resolves correctly.

If I search lon,lat; [`86.922623,27.986065`](https://www.google.com/search?q=86.922623%2C27.986065), it resolves incorrectly (to the middle of the Arctic Ocean).

But the Mapbox API expects [`lnglat`])https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#project), here the reverse of the Google example would occur.

This inconsistency is seen everywhere...

### Use Latitude,Longitude order

## How to tame this mess

There's some consensus growing around longitude, latitude order for geospatial formats, but still chaos for libraries and software. 

You need to be very careful when working with decimalised latitude and longitude (_or longitude and latitude value_), and ensure you send them / read them in the order defined in the documentation of the tool you're using.
