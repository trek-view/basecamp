**Giving everyone the confidence to explore**

Originally [Map the Paths](https://www.mapthepaths.com/) was designed to scratch an itch here at Trek View; to have a way to easily classify the 360 outdoor virtual tour imagery our Trekkers captured.

We're coming up to the nine month mark, and in the past few months we've seen a number of innovative ways organisations are using our software to improve accessibility issues.

I've also received some lovely emails from people telling me Map the Paths has given them the confidence to explore a new place.

Here are some of the reason why...

## Surface type

Smooth surfaces are not always guaranteed. Map the Paths automatically classifies what's inside an image, including objects and surfaces to help people make a decision on whether they can tackle it.

## Gradients

Uneven or steep gradients also pose a challenge. Map the Paths shows the gradient, and it shows the elevation profile of the route allowing people to quickly zoom in on the potentially tricky bits.

## Obstruction and dangers

Narrow paths, stiles, barriers can stop people in their tracks. Map the Paths tags allow anyone to mark barriers, obstructions and hazards (amongst other things) so that these spots can be reviewed before setting out.

[Label challenges are also used to successfully crowd-source label contributions from the community](https://www.mapthepaths.com/challenge/label/list/).

## Amenities

Knowing what facilities are available can be one of the most important concerns for many people. Map the Paths point of interest overlays allow people to navigate tourist attractions, but also whether the places en-route are suitable for them (e.g. wheelchair friendly, have toilets, etc.).

## Help improve the map

Map the Paths is a free software. [It's also open-source](https://github.com/trek-view/mtp-web).

If you're looking to help improve knowledge about the accessibility of a local area, grab a camera ([here's a handy guide](https://guides.trekview.org/trek-pack/v2)) and start benefiting from these Map the Paths features ([here's a look at a few more](/blog/2021/map-the-paths-whats-new-january)).

You can also [start browsing existing Map the Paths imagery immediately](https://www.mapthepaths.com/).
