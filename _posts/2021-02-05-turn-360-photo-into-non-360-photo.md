**Use GIMP to transform a 360 photo into a flat photo that looks perfect, and is easy to share.**

360 images offer amazing views of the world.

However, sometimes you just want to share a "normal", flat photo with someone, without the need for a 360 viewer.

Many 360 camera manufacturers bundle software with their cameras that allow you to take grabs of your 360 photos and videos.

In [GoPro Player](https://community.gopro.com/t5/en/GoPro-Player/ta-p/413305) you can use the "Export" option to grab an image in a resolution of your choosing.

In the [Insta360 Studio](https://www.insta360.com/download) itâ€™s done by selecting "Snapshot" and then the "Normal View" option.

Sometimes you might want even more control over the output.

You can also use free image tools to achieve the same results, but also giving more control on the output.

### Step 0: Download GIMP 2.10 (other programs are available)

You can make little planets in most graphical programs, including Adobe Photoshop.

In this example I'll us GIMP because it's completely free and easy to use.

[You can download it here](https://www.gimp.org/).

### Step 1: Select your 360 image (or video frame)

You'll need an image file. 

The manufacturers software often supports grabbing part of a video frame.

[The Map the Paths Desktop Uploader allows you to convert 360 videos into 360 photo frames](https://www.mapthepaths.com/uploader), which could be another solution to get a 360 image from a video to use with GIMP.

### Step 2: Convert to a flat image

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2021-02-05/gimp-transform-360.jpg

Now convert the 360 image to a flat projection by selecting:

"Filters" > "Map" > "Panorama Projection"

Now you can adjust the angles and view of the photo until the frame looks perfect.

You can now save ("Export" option in GIMP) the image to share with the world.

### Step 3: Share your creations with us
