**An update on our summer "call for trekkers".**

At the start of summer we put out a ["call for trekkers" to map waterways](/blog/2019/2019-05-31-call-for-trekkers-summer-autumn).

Many of you have been exploring stretches of water around the globe.

Here are some of the places I've shot this summer on my standup paddleboard.

## The River Thames, England

Transport type: SUP

346 km in total. I covered about 100 km this year between Oxford and Kew on a paddle-board. From big cities and million Pound mansions to rolling hills and farm yards.

## Wey Navigations, England

Transport type: SUP

My "local" river. Passing through the beauty of the Surrey countryside from  Godalming to Weybridge where it joins the Thames. My only complaint -- navigating through the many locks! Life could be worse.

Transport type: SUP

The Basingstoke Canal runs for 51 kilometres, from Greywell Village in Hampshire to Woodham in Surrey. My only complaint -- more locks!

Transport type: SUP

The Kennet and Avon Canal is a waterway in southern England with an overall length of 140 kilometres, made up of two lengths of navigable river linked by a canal. My only complaint -- even more locks!

## Call for Winter trekkers

The good weather is still around, at least in the UK, and [I'm hoping to capture some more locations before the winter weather returns](/blog/2019/360-degree-view-water-tours).

Watch out for an update in the next month with a call for winter trekkers.
