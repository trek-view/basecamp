**I look back at my imagery I've captured this season and show how you can do the same.**

[A few weeks ago I talked about the problems cold temperatures have on LiIon batteries, and how I was preparing my kit for cold weather](/blog/keeping-gopro-max-warm-extend-battery-life).

As those that know me might have guessed, this was in preperation for going skiing!

Here is some of the piste-level imagery I captured in the French Alps this year...

## Val Thorens, Meribel, and Courchevel

## How can I do this?

Hopefully this has inspired many of you to try to record your own footage this season and place it on the map. The good news; it's not as difficult as you might think.

Here is everything you need to know;

1. [Buy a GoPro MAX and helmet mount](/blog/announcing-trek-pack-v2)
2. [Set it up so that it performs well in cold weather](/blog/keeping-gopro-max-warm-extend-battery-life)
3. Record footage in video mode (5.2k @ 24 FPS)
4. [Break the footage up into frames (optional, not required if only for upload to Street View / Mapillary)](/blog/turn-360-video-into-timelapse-images-part-1)
