**I look back at my imagery from last season and show how you can do the same this year.**

[Last March I promised you street-level imagery of some of the best French ski resorts](/blog/2022/creating-360-street-level-maps-europe-ski-resorts-part-1).

In this case I believe the saying _"better late than never"_ holds true.

With the ski season already well underway in the French Alps, here is the long promised imagery I shot last year.

## Val Thorens, Meribel, and Courchevel

## How can I do this?

Hopefully this has inspired many of you to try to record your own footage this season and place it on the map. The good news; it's not as difficult as you might think.

Here is everything you need to know;

1. [Buy a GoPro MAX and helmet mount](/blog/2020/announcing-trek-pack-v2)
2. [Set it up so that it performs well in cold weather](/blog/2022/keeping-gopro-max-warm-extend-battery-life)
3. Record footage in video mode (5.2k @ 24 FPS)
4. [Break the footage up into frames (optional, not required if only for upload to apps)](/blog/2021/turn-360-video-into-timelapse-images-part-1)
5. Upload to [Trek View Explorer](https://www.trekview.org/), [Google Street View](https://streetviewstudio.maps.google.com), and [Facebook's Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/desktop-uploader).
