**Using mapping tools for a positive impact in the world including; forest data, accessibility, wildfires, and augmented reality.**

It's that time of year again. Google's Geo for Good annual summit took place from the 16th - 19th of November 2021.

The summit is intended for nonprofits, scientists and other change-makers who want to leverage technology and use mapping tools for a positive impact in the world.

2021 was the 10th summit, [and like last years summit](/blog/my-favourite-geo-for-good-summit-talks-2020), was held virtually.

You can view all of the videos from the Geo for Good Summit on the [Google Earth Outreach micro-site here](https://earthoutreachonair.withgoogle.com/events/geoforgood21/).

Here are my personal favourites.

By Steve DeRoy and Isabel DeRoy-Olson

Local communities possess expert knowledge of their environment which can be represented on a map. Google Earth can be combined with participatory methods, empowering local communities to build their own maps.

By Ermes Tuon

This project empowers people to make their own decisions by allowing them to decide themselves if somewhere is accessible for their needs. The team use Google Earth to map images and structured information about locations for this purpose.

If you're interested in wildfires, be sure to check out another talk at the summit from Christiaan Adams and Christophe Restif titled; [Animating Wildfire Datasets in Earth Engine](https://earthoutreachonair.withgoogle.com/events/geoforgood21?talk=crisis-wildfires).

## Augmenting Reality During Natural Disasters with Google Earth Studio

By Ariana Mercer

One of the most powerful ways to communicate the scale and scope of natural disasters is imagery. This talk presents work from the CEDR Digital Corps doing just that.
