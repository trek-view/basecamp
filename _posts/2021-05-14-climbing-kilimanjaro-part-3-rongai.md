**Trek one of the quietest trails up Kilimanjaro from home.**

[Last week saw us embark on a virtual expedition on the Machame Route](/blog/climbing-kilimanjaro-part-2-machame).

This week we'll be tackling the Rongai Route.

Due to the remote location of its trailhead, Rongai is seldom visited by the trekkers.

It takes a long four-hour drive from the Moshi town (a popular travel hub) to get there. Yet, the experiences on Rongai are rewarding - the only route approaching Kilimanjaro from the North, it offers sheerly different vegetation and landscapes from what a one can see on the other Kilimanjaro route.

## Rainforest zone

The rainforest zone on the Rongai route is somewhat special from this zone in the south, east of west - it does not receive so much rainfall, and here the hikers have a chance to see coniferous trees.

## Heather and Moorland

At around 2800 m the heather and moorland zone begins. This is where the rainforest zone recedes, eventually giving way to heather. The higher we go, the less thick vegetation becomes.

## Alpine desert

Alpine (or Highland) desert starts at 4000 m. These fields look empty and desolated. This area gets the least rainfall of all - less than 8 inches every year. The vegetation is meagre, as very few plants can handle burning say at daytime and subzero temperatures at night.

## Arctic Zone

<iframe width="600" height="400" allowfullscreen style="border-style:none;" src="https://www.trekview.org/trekviewer.htm#panorama=https://www.trekview.org/assets/images/blog/2021-05-14/arctic-zone.jpeg&amp;autoLoad=true"></iframe>

The Arctic zone starts at 5000m and tops at Uhuru Peak at 5,895m. Its lower area is known as “scree” - the mass of loose pebble, gravel and soil. It is one of the reasons why all summits start at night - low temperatures freeze pieces of this scree together, making it less loose and allowing the boots to have better traction.

## Uhuru Peak (5,895m)

Congratulations you are now at Uhuru Peak, Tanzania. 5895 AMSL.

## Altezza Travel

This Guidebook would not have been possible without the studious team at Altezza Travel.

They're taking bookings for the 2021 season, including the Rogai route. [See the Altezza Travel website for more details](https://en.altezza.travel/).

## More soon...

Sadly we could only able to film two treks ([see the Machame Route here](/blog/climbing-kilimanjaro-part-2-machame))) due to timings over the January to March trekking season. 

When the good weather for trekking returns again in June, we'll be hoping for a few more drier days to [capture the missing imagery with our Trek Packs](/trek-pack).
