**I look back at my imagery from this season and show how you can do the same this year.**

Another ski season is over, for me anyway.

It has been another year of bad snow here in Europe, though there were a few very good weeks.

Here's where I've skied...

## Serre Chevallier (France)

## How can I do this?

Hopefully this has inspired many of you to try to record your own footage this season and place it on the map. The good news; it's not as difficult as you might think.

Here is everything you need to know;

1. [Buy a GoPro MAX and helmet mount](/blog/2020/announcing-trek-pack-v2)
2. [Set it up so that it performs well in cold weather](/blog/2022/keeping-gopro-max-warm-extend-battery-life)
3. Record footage in video mode (5.2k @ 24 FPS)
4. [Break the footage up into frames (optional, not required if only for upload to apps)](/blog/2021/turn-360-video-into-timelapse-images-part-1)
5. Upload to [Trek View Explorer](https://www.trekview.org/), [Google Street View](https://streetviewstudio.maps.google.com), and [Facebook's Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/desktop-uploader).
