**A crew of 16 left New Zealand on an 8,000 mile pacific crossing to Patagonia, with a stop in Antarctica.**

The vessel is Infinity, a 120ft hand-built sailing ketch that plies the Pacific Ocean on a never ending voyage of nomadic exploration. In early Feb 2014, during the iciest year on record in the Southern Ocean, Infinity and her crew of 16 left New Zealand on an 8,000 mile pacific crossing to Patagonia, with a stop in Antarctica.

This is a story about sailing, the camaraderie of a shared struggle and the raw awe inspiring power of the natural world.

In this episode of ExPODition, David talks with director Nico Edwards about being a crewmember onboard the Infinity.

The conversation was recorded remotely on September 29th, 2020.
