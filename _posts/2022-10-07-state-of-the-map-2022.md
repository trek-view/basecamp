**Navigation for prams, GPS accuracy of cameras, pedestrian and bike infrastructure, entry-level mapping, and a 360 street-level imagery project in Belgium.**

For the first time in two year, State of the Map took place in person in Florence, Italy, from August 19th to August 21st, 2022.

There were some brilliant talks at this years conference, [now available to watch back on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQNy8KsDknCo4Hpk5_trylRC8FD2ge9ns).

[The full programme can be viewed here](https://2022.stateofthemap.org/programme/).

I've curated some of my favourite talks most closely linked to the work we do here at Trek View that I know you'll enjoy.

_Don't forget to check out my favourite talks from [2020](/blog/2020/state-of-the-map-2020) and [2021](/blog/2021/state-of-the-map-2021) too._

## Routing not only for Prams

Routing for pedestrians is a much broader challenge than the well-known car routing. Cars all over the world are mostly uniform, but pedestrians vary widely in their capabilities.

A lot of details that a sportive person might not even notice can be a roadblocker for people with prams, for wheelchair users or simply lesser-abled people with not enough strength for a complete stairway.

This is a problem we're trying to address with Trek View imagery and this talk by Roland Olbricht, from an urban point of view, offers some interesting approaches.

## A review of Mapillary-generated map data and how accuracy compares across devices

Another issues we're more than familiar with -- positional accuracy reported by cameras.

Said Turksever from Mapillary/Meta introduces a case study of the positional accuracy using a variety of different cameras assessed against Mapillary data.

One interesting takeaway is that GoPro cameras, used in our Trek Packs, came up top in terms of positional accuracy against the other cameras used in the experiment.

## Pedestrian and Bike Mapping in New York City

New York City (and much of America) has sidewalks that end abruptly, intersections without proper pedestrian control, uncontrolled slip lanes, bike paths that lead into stairways, crossings without curb cuts.

The New York City OSM community is interested in keeping track of pedestrian features throughout the five boroughs. Both to improve routing and to keep track of dangerous or poorly designed infrastructure.

In this talk Ariel Kadouri shares examples of areas that have been mapped and where they brush up against the guidelines for bike and pedestrian mapping.

## Entry-level Mobile Mapping

A lot of the work we do here at Trek View requires 360 cameras, which for most people are prohibitivley expensive. This really bothers me as it is a big limitation for mapping many parts of the world.

However, with limitations comes innovative solutions. By 2025, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) aims that communities in 94 countries vulnerable to disaster or experiencing multidimensional poverty are equipped and able to map the locations where they live and work.

Kristen Tonga explains recent HOT research will followed by specific suggestions for those doing mobile OSM mapping, especially at the entry-level, as well as technical proposals for tooling improvement.

## 360 Imagery Everywhere

Joost Schouppe and the team at OSM Belgium have been working on a project I've been following with interest; [Open Street Level Imagery](https://openstreetmap.be/en/projects/streetlevelimagery.html).

The vision of the project overlaps greatly with some of the things I've been trying to achieve with Trek View.

As Joost shows in the talk, the team at OSM Belgium have made some good progress so far. Long may it continue.
