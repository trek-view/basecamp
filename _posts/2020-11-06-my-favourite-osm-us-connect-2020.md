**All available to watch now.**

[Last week OSM US held their annual Connect conference](https://www.openstreetmap.us/connect2020/). As with almost all conferences this year, Connect 2020 also found itself being hosted virtually for the first time.

You can view all of the videos from Connect 2020 on the [OSM US YouTube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQpS2iHNVR-_6nAxt87nwCw/videos).

Here are my picks.


## Open Street Art (Bond Harper)

Our streets are full of art, from colourful murals to grand statues. Unlike private and public art collections, street art is available to everyone, at any time, and for zero cost (mostly).

Bond talks about mapping (and discovering) street art in Open Street Map.

## A Satellite in Your Pocket: Ground Based Action Cameras to Create Aerial Perspective for OSM Editing (Sean Gorman)

To enable a future powered by augmented reality, autonomous vehicles and digital mapping we need a global high definition 3D map. This can only be achieved by utilising the broad array of data sources imaging our world - camera phones, 360 video, drones, aerial, satellite, radar, LiDAR.

Sean demos some impressive examples of high definition 3D maps in action.

## Reinventing the Wheel (Emily Eros and Russ Biggs)

Curb regulations are communicated by physical assets like parking signs, meters, and curb paint. These have a specific set of coordinates and are easy to map. But the concepts they convey are more difficult. For example, a pair of parking signs are more than just two independent points; they represent an invisible rule that applies to a specific section of a particular edge of a specific street. Curb regulations are regulatory geometries, not physical geometries.

Emily and Russ talk about their invention, the CurbWheel, to help them better collect this type of data.

## Using Street-Level Imagery to Save Cyclists (David Greenwood)

We want to eliminate all road cyclist-vehicle deaths by crowdsourcing safer bike lane design. Using action cameras, accident data, computer vision and OpenStreetMap; potential hazards to cyclists can be automatically identified,  the optimum bike lane design deduced, and recommended improvements provided to infrastructure planners.
