Keyhole Markup Language KML is a file format used to display geographic data.

It was developed by Google

KML was developed for use with Google Earth, which was originally named Keyhole Earth Viewer. It was created by Keyhole, Inc, which was acquired by Google in 2004. 

KML became an international standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium in 2008, though it's still mostly used only in Google Earth.

 in an Earth browser such as Google Earth.

The KML file specifies a set of features (place marks, images, polygons, 3D models, textual descriptions, etc.) that can be displayed on maps in geospatial software implementing the KML encoding. Each place always has a longitude and a latitude. Other data can make the view more specific, such as tilt, heading, altitude, which together define a "camera view" along with a timestamp or timespan. KML shares some of the same structural grammar as Geography Markup Language (GML).
