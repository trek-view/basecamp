<p>Hi! My name's Dave.</p>

<p>In 2019 I took a GoPro Fusion 360-degree camera and started filming some of my hikes.</p>

<p>My images quickly attracted millions of views in Street View. Viewers asked me how they could do the same, so I showed them.</p>

<p><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/global/streetview-stats.png" alt="Trek View Street View" title="Trek View Street View" /></p>

<p>And so Trek View became a thing.</p>

<p>Looking at the numbers, I realised there was a huge interest for using street-level imagery to map exploration of the natural world -- like Street View, but for adventures.</p>

<p>Imagine being able to filter the imagery by altitude, elevation changes, terrain, distance, how they were taken (hike, ski, bike, etc.).</p>

<p>This is exactly what I am currently working on. <a href="/blueprint">Read the full blueprint of what is in my mind here</a>.</p>

<p>My aim is to keep as much of this project freely available via <a href="/blog">how-to guides on our blog</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://campfire.trekview.org">community forum</a>. Whilst trying to keep as much of the code developed <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/trek-view/">open-source on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you find the content here useful, and cannot wait to see your imagery on the map!</p>

<p>p.s I'll be posting regular updates to all Trek View forum members. If you'd like to hear about the latest developments with the project, make sure to sign up.</p>
