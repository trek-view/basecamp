<h3>What is Trek View?</h3>

<p>Hi! I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/himynamesdave/" target="_blank">Dave</a>.</p>

<p>In 2019 I took a GoPro Fusion 360-degree camera and started filming some of my hikes.</p>

<p>They quickly attracted millions of views online and other hikers asked me how they could do the same. So I showed them.</p>

<p>Hikes turned into mountain bike trails. Bike trails into ski runs. Ski runs into scuba dives...</p>

<p>At around the same time, I became interested in cartography. Being a geek at heart this quickly led to many late-night experiments building map making software. Others were interested in this software, so I shared that too.</p>

<p>I quickly realised there was a huge interest for using street-level imagery to map various explorations -- like Street View, but for adventures.</p>

<p>And so Trek View became a thing.</p>

<p>My aim is to keep as much of this project freely available, via <a href="./blog">how-to guides on our blog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trek-view/">open-source software on GitHub</a>. I'm also <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/trekview/shared_invite/zt-1gb4upchi-52pmWhPiwhFaAQqm0vWmJg">trying to foster a community of outdoor enthusiasts and software developers interested in the project on Slack</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you find some of the content here useful, and cannot wait to see your imagery on the map!</p>
