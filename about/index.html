	<h3>What is Trek View?</h3>

	<p>Hi! I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/himynamesdave/" target="_blank">Dave</a>.</p>

	<p>Back in 2019 I took a 360-degree camera and started filming hiking trails.</p>

	<p>They quickly attracted millions of views online and other hikers asked me how they could do the same. So I showed them</a>.</p>

	<p>I created VR apps for schools allowing school children to go on virtual field trips -- many of whom had never left the cities in which they lived.</p>

	<p>Then local community groups, larger commercial organisations and even some celebrities wanted to use the photos for their own environmental causes.</p>

	<p>At the same time, I became interested in computer vision, the ability to train a computer to automatically classify what's inside an image.</p>

	<p>I quickly realised the potential for using street-level images to understand the environment at scale was huge.</p>

	<p>And so Trek View became a thing.</p>

	<p>Now we're a group of people with a passion for the outdoors.</p>

	<p>Our imagery is viewed by millions of people each month.</p>
