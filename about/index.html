	<h3>What is Trek View?</h3>

	<p>Hi! I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/himynamesdave/" target="_blank">Dave</a>.</p>

	<p>Back in 2019 I took a 360-degree camera and started filming hiking trails.</p>

	<p>They quickly attracted millions of views online and other hikers asked me how they could do the same. <a href="/blog/2019/diy-google-street-view-part-1-how-trek-view-started/">So I showed them</a>.</p>

	<p>I created VR apps for schools allowing school children to go on virtual field trips -- many of whom had never left the cities in which they lived.</p>

	<p>Then local community groups, larger commercial organisations and even some celebrities wanted to use the photos for their own environmental causes.</p>

	<p>At the same time, I became interested in computer vision, the ability to train a computer to automatically classify what's inside an image.</p>

	<p>I quickly realised the potential for using panoramic images to understand the environment at scale was huge.</p>

	<p>And so Trek View became a thing.</p>

	<p>Now we're a group of people with a passion for the outdoors.</p>

	<h3>How is Trek View imagery used?</h3>

	<p>Our imagery is viewed by over 200,000 people each month, including;</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>K12 Education: Teachers use <a href="https://treehouse.trekview.org" target="_blank">our virtual field trips and live video calls with researchers in the field</a> to provide students with an interactive way to cover curriculum content.</li>
			<li>Sustainable Tourism: Commercial organisations, like national parks and tourism boards, publish their outdoor locations as virtual tours to encourage new visitors whilst showing them how to visit responsibly.</li>
			<li>Disaster Response: <a href="/blog/2020/mapping-the-unmapped-using-360-degree-photos/">NGO partners collect imagery in disaster settings</a>, where it is extremely important to get accurate information from the field to plan a response.</li>
